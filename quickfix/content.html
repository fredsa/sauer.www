The need to print barcodes on document output from Oracle Applications
is prevalent mostly in the Supply Chain modules. For example printing
the Item Number on a label, Order number on an acknowledgment, etc.
But barcodes can be used in numerous places to increase productivity
and reduce errors!

As experienced Oracle Applications Developers we have been involved in
many projects where task on implementing barcode print outs was seen
as a major expenditure of cash and time, and it need not be. The
following short instructions detail all the setup that is needed to
print

Assumptions:
- Foobar was originally written for 3of9 for HP/UX -11, but can be
  modified (by recompiling) for any operating system
- You system has a C compiler (UNIX does)
- You are using PCL compatible printers
</pre>

<pre style="display: none;" id="postscript">
While Oracle Reports 2.5 provides the ability to generate bitmap (or
graphical) reports within Oracle Financials, output on UNIX platforms
is still limited to Postscript only.  While most all laser printers
are PCL compatible, a smaller number are also Postscript. So how do
you print your bitmapped output from Oracle Financials to the
non-Postscript, PCL only printers?

A solution to this problem could be to purchase postscript cartridges
for each and every printer to which you wish to print bitmap reports.
But this is usually an expensive option and likely not in the project
budget

Another solution involves a little setup, some time with a UNIX savvy
system administrator, a web browser and an Internet connection in
order to download the necessary free software.

This document describes how Oracle Financials bitmap reports can be
printed to PCL only LaserJet (compatible) printers.
</pre>

<pre style="display: none;" id="email">
The purpose of this document and the accompanying script
report2email.sh is to enable you to send Oracle Financials report
output automatically to the user via email. This can be done
interactively or through batch submitted programs and requires no
customizations/changes to the documents you will be emailing. You will
have the option to send the report as part of the body of the email
message or as an attachment.

When sending as an attachment you can choose any file type to send as,
so that the application of your choice will automatically open when
you double-click on your email attachment. For example, if you choose
a file type of csv, Excel will open and it will automatically attempt
to convert the text of the report to columns using the user's most
recent choices when Data | Text to columns. was last selected in
Excel. If doc is used Word will automatically open. A special case is
when rtf is used as the extension. The shell script will recognize
this extension and add to the character report RTF formatting
information such as which font to use and whether or not the report
should be shown portrait or landscape. Finally, for mail clients that
do not support UUENCODED attachments you have the option of sending
attached inline (in the body of the email) or as the MIME type
text/plain.

In general, the concepts are the same as printing to a regular
printer, but several features are detailed in this document that will
enable you users to take advantage of advanced feature. Some steps
detailed here are OPTIONAL. To harness the full-featured functionality
you must complete all the setup steps. However the shell script will
still work if you have only performed the REQUIRED steps, provided you
have meet the 'Optional Assumptions' in each OPTIONAL step.

Background
Users of Oracle Financials often have the need to print postscript or
bitmapped out put directly from
the application. This is most common when you print external customer
documents from Oracle
Financials, such as invoices, checks, sales quotes, shipping notices,
purchase orders, etc. You want
these documents to be pretty and present a nice easy to read layout to
your customers and vendors.
The problem is that Oracles standard reports (those shipped with the
applications) do not meet this
goal. They are often poorly organized and do not contain all the
information you want your partners to
view. And there is a misconception that Oracle Financials does not
have the ability to print anything
but the monotone, same font, same point size output.

The solution lays in using Reports Developer and a few extra setup
steps in System Administration. The end result is that you can print
beautiful  reports with logos, lines, boxes, graphics, charts and
barcodes directly from Oracle
Financials.

There is no need to use 3  party software or products. With the power
of Developer 2000 and the
flexibility of Oracle Financials it can be achieved with minimal
effort. If you follow these instructions
you should be printing postscript output within the day!
