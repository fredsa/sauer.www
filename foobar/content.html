Supply Chain modules. For example printing the Item Number on a label, Order number on an
acknowledgment, etc. But barcodes can be used in numerous places to increase productivity and
reduce errors!</p>

on implementing barcode print outs was seen as a major expenditure of cash and time, and it need not
be.</p>
